# SpotifySongPrediction
Many music listeners use the Spotify application and
create thousands of playlists on a daily basis. Many users want
to group songs by genre when creating these playlists, but the
Spotify application does not provide information about the genres
to which the songs belong. As a result, in this project, we aim
to detect the genre and mode of Spotify songs and playlists. By
doing so, we hope to provide users with a more intuitive and
convenient way to organize their music by genre. This will allow
them to more easily find and listen to the types of music that
they enjoy, and to create more diverse and dynamic playlists.
